# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**I use for doing this challenge HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:
- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
